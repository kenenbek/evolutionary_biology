Code Challenge: Solve the Limb Length Problem.

Input: An integer _n_, followed by an integer _j_ between _0_ and _n - 1_, followed by a space-separated additive distance matrix D (whose elements are integers).

Output: The limb length of the leaf in Tree(D) corresponding to row j of this distance matrix (use 0-based indexing).
